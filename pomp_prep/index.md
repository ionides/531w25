------------------------------

Please read the appropriate sections below, which give specific instructions for installing and testing the `pomp` software and other packages we will be using for data analysis using POMP models.
First follow the instructions for "all users", then those for your specific operating system (OS).

<div class="nb"> 

**Important note:** If you run into problems, email ionides@umich.edu with a detailed description of the problem you've encountered.
In this message, **be certain to include all of the following information**:

- the operating system you’re running,
- the version numbers of **R**, **Rstudio**, and **pomp** you’re attempting to install,
- what command(s) you've executed, and
- what error messages you've received.

In particular, it is often easiest to send a screenshot or transcript showing the commands you've entered and the error messages you've received.
In **R**, you can run `Sys.info()` to get a printout of the operating system and software version numbers.

## All users

### Install **R** and **RStudio**

You’ll need at least version 4.3.1 of **R**.
Source code and binaries are available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/).
Install *the latest version* of **RStudio** from [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Install needed packages

Open a session in **RStudio** and run the following:

```
> update.packages()
> source("https://ionides.github.io/531w25/pomp_prep/packages.R")
```

*[The `>` is the command prompt; it is not part of the command.
Also, depending on your email client propgram, you may need to replace the quotation marks with plain keyboard double quotes.]*

The first command updates your installed packages.
You may be prompted to specify a CRAN mirror:
choose one geographically near you.
In **RStudio**, you can also push the "Update" button on the "Packages" tab to accomplish this.

The second command runs a script on my website.
It will install some needed packages if these are not already installed on your system.

-------------------------------

## Windows users

If your machine runs Windows, you must install **Rtools**.
This will give you the ability to compile C code and dynamically link it into an **R** session.

[Download **Rtools** from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and install it.
A <a href="https://youtu.be/lmIhiT_QsPE" target="_blank">video tutorial demonstrating how to install **Rtools** </a> may be helpful. Also, [detailed installation instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) are available on CRAN.
*Note that, after installation, there is one more step to be completed.*

-------------------------------

## MacOSX users

So that you can compile C code and dynamically link it into an **R** session, you will need to have the **Xcode** app installed.
This is gratis and can be installed via the App Store or downloaded from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/download/).
Video tutorials demonstrating how to [check if you need to install Xcode](https://youtu.be/j0kqPpMecp4),
[how to install Xcode](https://youtu.be/aryEseip6Mk), and
[how to install pomp once you have installed Xcode](https://youtu.be/ikvJcN3Zi2w) are available.

Note that you must go beyond merely installing the **Xcode** app.
After you've installed the app, open a unix terminal (listed as the **Terminal** app under "Utilities" in the Finder) and run the following line
```
xcode-select --install
```
This will install the "Command Line Tools" that are needed to compile native C codes. Running this command is tantamount to the part of the Xcode installation tutorial video where we complete the installation using the graphical user interface.

### Test **pomp**

Open a session in **RStudio** and run the following:
```
> source("https://kingaa.github.io/scripts/pompTest.R")
```
This will check whether you can work with **pomp**.

If it fails, try the following:
```
> source("https://kingaa.github.io/scripts/hello.R",echo=TRUE)
```
If this fails to give the "Hello!" message, you will need to follow the instructions below that correspond to your OS before re-trying the `pompTest.R` script.

### Linux and unix

If you have trouble with any of the scripts above, make sure you have the GNU compiler collection (GCC), including **gfortran**, installed on your computer.
Linux distributions typically include this by default but it is not impossible that you have somehow avoided this.

### MacOSX

If the `pompTest.R` script fails because you cannot load **pomp**, try installing it from source.
The easiest way to do this is to use the **devtools** package.
Do
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("kingaa/pomp")
```
If, while trying to install from source, you receive the error,
```
make: gfortran-8.2: No such file or directory
```
or one that otherwise refers to `gfortran`, then it is likely that you do not have the necessary version of **gfortran** installed.
Have a look at [these instructions](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) and contact me at the address above if these don’t work for you.
Note that you may need to install specifically [gfortran-12.2](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg).

Some users have reported receiving an error complaining that 
```
'stdlib.h' file not found
```
This indicates that the command-line tools from **Xcode** have not been properly installed.
In a unix terminal, run 
```
xcode-select --install
```
to correct this problem.

### Windows

You have probably failed to install the **Rtools** correctly.
Revisit the [instructions above](#windows-users).
