We return to another case study from the short course [Simulation-Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) (SBIED). Chapter 18 is Lesson 5 of SBIED. In Chapters 12--15, we used a single measles outbreak as a relatively simple example to demonstrate POMP models and inference. Now we see how an extension of this analysis becomes a topic of scientific interest. Modeling longer time series can be more challenging, since it is not simply enough to have a model that can describe how an epidemic wave surges and then retreats. On the other hand, the additional data from a sequence of outbreaks can inform a more detailed model.

We will focus on two new topics arising in the case study:

* When can we make a causal interpretation of estimated model parameters?

* We see that the scale of the variability matters for successful modeling. We show how to model dynamic stochasticity by adding noise to the rates of a Markov chain.
