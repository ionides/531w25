On Wednesday 4/23, or soon after, you should receive by email an assignment for two final project peer review reports. Summary points from past final review reports are available online for  [2024](https://ionides.github.io/531w24/final_project/), [2022](https://ionides.github.io/531w22/final_project/) and [2021](https://ionides.github.io/531w21/final_project/). You are welcome to look at these for ideas when writing your reports. A [sample report](sample-final-peer-review/main.pdf) is also provided. Reviews are graded according to the same [posted rubric](../rubric_midterm_review.html) as for the midterm.

All the projects will be listed at https://ionides.github.io/531w25/final_project/index.html within a day or two, but you should have access to the particular projects you are refereeing via Canvas. Let me know if you do not.

Please submit your review report as a pdf file on Canvas, by  Wed 4/30, 11:59pm. The reviews will not be posted publicly, and those who wrote the project should remain blind to your identity. Please do not unblind yourself, and do not question others on which reports they are reviewing. In other words, treat this process with the same respect expected of professional academic peer review. It is not a major problem if you discover who reviews your work, but the review process works well under anonymity. Each report should identify the main strengths and weaknesses of the project (from both technical and conceptual perspectives) as well as identifying points with room for improvement. The Rmd file and other source files are available on the class GitHub repository, and it is appropriate for your report to include comments on coding decisions and reproducibility. The expected length of each report is at least 500 words. Your report can be shorter if you find the project is so strong that there is not much criticism to find, but it is unusual that a careful reading cannot find any technical weaknesses or substantial room for improvement
