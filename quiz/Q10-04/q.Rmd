The iterated filtering convergence diagnostics plot shown above come from a [student project](https://ionides.github.io/531w21/final_project/project15/blinded.html), calculated using $10^3$ particles. What is the best interpretation?

A: Everything seems to be working fine. There is a clear consensus from the different searches concerning the highest likelihood that can be found. Therefore, the search is doing a good job of maximization. Occasional searches get lost, such as the purple line with a low likelihood, but that is not a problem.

B: The seaches obtain likelihood values spread over thousands of log units. We would like to see consistent convergence within a few log units. We should use more particles and/or more iterations to achieve this.

C: The seaches obtain likelihood values spread over thousands of log units. We would like to see consistent convergence within a few log units.
We should compare the best likelihoods obtained with simple statistical models, such as an auto-regressive moving average model, to look for evidence of model misspecification.

D: The seaches obtain likelihood values spread over thousands of log units. We would like to see consistent convergence within a few log units.
We should look at the effective sample size plot for the best fit we have found yet, to see whether there are problems with the particle filtering.

E: All of B, C, and D.
