Let $V_n$ be a Markov process and let $W_n=h(V_n)$ for some function $h$.
Let  $(X_n,Y_n)$ be a POMP with latent process $X_n$ and observed process $Y_n$.
Which of the following statements are true?

i. $W_n$ is a Markov process for all choices of $h$.

i. $W_n$ is a Markov process for some choices of $h$.

i. $W_n$ is not a Markov process for any choice of $h$.

i. If $V_n=(X_n,Y_n)$ and $h(X_n,Y_n)=X_n$ then $W_n$ is a Markov process.

i. If $V_n=(X_n,Y_n)$ and $h(X_n,Y_n)=Y_n$ then $W_n$ is a Markov process.

**A**. i,iv,v\
**B**. ii,iv\
**C**. ii,v\
**D**. iii\
**E**. Some combination other than those listed above
