Effective sample size (ESS) is one of the main tools for diagnosing the success of a particle filter.
If you plot an object of class `pfilterd_pomp` (created by applying `pfilter` to a pomp object), the ESS is displayed.
Suppose one or more time points have low ESS (say, less than 10) even when using a fairly large number of particles (say, $10^4$).
What is the proper interpretation?

**A**. There is a problem with data, perhaps an error recording an observation.\
**B**. There is a problem with the model which means that it cannot explain something in the data.\
**C**. The model and data have no major problems, but the model happens to be problematic for the particle filter algorithm.\
**D**. At least one of A, B, and C.\
**E**. Either A or B or both, but not C. If the model fits the data well, the particle filter is guaranteed to work well.
