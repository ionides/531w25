Multiple choice question title: Iterated filtering diagnostics: COVID-19: https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class22.pdf

Question text: The question is posted at https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class22.pdf

Answers: 

A: Everything seems to be working fine. There is a clear consensus from the different searches concerning the highest likelihood that can be found. Therefore, the search is doing a good job of maximization. Occasional searches get lost, such as the purple line with a low likelihood, but that is not a problem.

B: The searches obtain likelihood values spread over thousands of log units. We would like to see consistent convergence within a few log units. We should use more particles and/or more iterations to achieve this.

C: The searches obtain likelihood values spread over thousands of log units. We would like to see consistent convergence within a few log units.
We should compare the best likelihoods obtained with simple statistical models, such as an auto-regressive moving average model, to look for evidence of model misspecification.

D: The searches obtain likelihood values spread over thousands of log units. We would like to see consistent convergence within a few log units.
We should look at the effective sample size plot for the best fit we have found yet, to see whether there are problems with the particle filtering.

E: All of B, C, and D.


2. essay question title: Supporting reasoning

Give some supporting reasoning for your answer. You are expected to write between one and three sentences.

For this assignment, the credit is for the showing some reasoning, not for correctness.
