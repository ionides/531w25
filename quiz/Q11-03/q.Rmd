You fit an SEIR model to case reports of an immunizing disease from a city. The resulting confidence interval for the mean latent period is 12--21 days, but clinical evidence points to a latent period averaging about 7 days. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this discrepancy?

**A**. The latent period may be confounded with some unmodeled aspect of the system, such as spatial or age structure. The model estimates an effective latent period at the population level, which may not perfectly match what is happening at the scale of individuals. 

**B**.  The discrepancy shows that something is substantially wrong with the model. Extra biological detail must be introduced with the goal of bringing the estimated parameter back in line with the known biology of the system.

**C**. The discrepancy is problematic, but fortunately can readily be fixed. Since we know the clinical value of this parameter with reasonable accuracy, we should simply use this value in the model rather than estimating it.

**D**. If the model fits the data statistically better than any known alternative model, then we have to take the estimated parameter at face value. It is certainly possible that the estimates in the literature correspond to some different population, or different strain, or have some other measurement bias such as corresponding to severe cases resulting in hospitalization. The discrepancy does not show that our model was wrong.

**E**. This discrepancy suggests that we should take advantage of both C and D above by putting a Bayesian prior on the latent period. By quantifying the degree of our skepticism about the previously established clinical value of 7 days, we can optimally combine that uncertainty with the evidence from this dataset.
