Multiple choice question title: The Heston stochastic volatility model: https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class24.pdf

Answers: 

A. The high likelihood shows this is a promising model despite the convergence problems identified in the figure. Attention to the diagnostics may lead to additional improvements.

B. The most important diagnostic feature is the observation that the log-likelihood trace plot peaks and then declines. From the y-axis scale we see the decline is of order 1000 log units. This is evidence of substantial model misspecification which should be addressed.

C. The most important dignostic feature is that the theta traces all drop quickly to zero. Since that is not a scientifically plausible value for the parameter, we can deduce that the model is unsuccessful despite its high likelihood.

D. The most important diagnostic feature is that phi is close to zero and well identified. This shows that the volatility is close to constant, and is supported by the high likelihood.

E. The decreasing likelihood and other convergence diagnostics problems show there is a problem with the model. Likely, there is a bug and the high likelihood obtained is simply an error.



2. essay question title: Supporting reasoning

Give some supporting reasoning for your answer. You are expected to write between one and three sentences.

For this assignment, the credit is for the showing some reasoning, not for correctness.
