Multiple choice question title: Iterated filtering diagnostics: COVID-19: https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class23.pdf

Question text: The question is posted at https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class23.pdf

Answers: 

A: The positive values of the log-likelihood are implausible. Perhaps the software actually reports the negative log-likelihood since many optimizers are designed to minimize rather than maximize.

B: The models are nested and so a larger model should mathematically have a larger likelihood. In this table, the larger model usually has lower likelihood, so optimization is problematic.

C: This table would make more sense if `logLik` in fact returns an AIC value. The preferred model is $(p,q)=(1,4)$.

D: The preferred model is $(p,q)=(1,1)$ since it is both the simplest model and the one with the highest log-likelihood.

E: `tseries::garch` produces something that is not the likelihood of $y_{1:N}$ or the AIC, and so we cannot readily compare it between models.



2. essay question title: Supporting reasoning

Give some supporting reasoning for your answer. You are expected to write between one and three sentences.

For this assignment, the credit is for the showing some reasoning, not for correctness.
