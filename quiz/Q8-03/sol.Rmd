**Solution**. C\
  For scientific calculations, you generally have to pick an arbitrary set of units and use it consistently.
  In `pomp`, this means that you have to use the same units for measurement times and within the latent process.
  For example, if your measurement times are in days (7,14,$\dots$) then rate parameters should have units $\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.
  A latent transition with mean duration 1 week would have corresponding rate $1/7 \mathrm{day}^{-1}$. 

When you report your answers, you can use any appropriate units depending on the scale of the quantity---for example, mean life expectancy in years, mean infection duration in days, accumulated cases over a week or a month.
Within the computer code, you are advised not to mix units.
That is because computers are not good at representing units; a computer is good at representing a number, say 2.5, but usually our code does not know if this number corresponds to 2.5 days or weeks or years.
2.5 hours is the same as 150 minutes, but we can't just replace 2.5 by 150 in our code and get the same answer.
That is in contrast to scientific work, where every numerical quantity should have its unit attached, and answers of 2.5hr and 150min are equally correct.
